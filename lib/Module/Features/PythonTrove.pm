# ABSTRACT: Put Python trove classifiers in your module

=head1 SYNOPSIS

To add Python trove classifiers in your module, just define C<%FEATURES>
variable:

 package YourModule;
 #ABSTRACT: Highlight Indonesian words from text

 our %FEATURES = (
     features => {
         PythonTrove => {
             # we use underscore (Development_Status instead of "Development
             # Status") because feature names in Module::Features need to be
             # /^\w+$/. feature values need not be.

             "Development_Status" => "3 - Alpha",

             "Intended_Audience" => "Developers",

             "License" => [
                 "OSI Approved :: Artistic License",
                 "OSI Approved :: GNU General Public License v2 or later (GPLv2+)",
             ],

             "Natural_Language" => "Indonesian",

             "Programming_Language" => "Perl",

             "Environment" => "Console",

             "Topic" => [
                 "Software Development :: Libraries :: Perl Modules",
                 "Text Processing :: Linguistic",
                 "Utilities",
             ],
         },

         # other features you might want to define
         # ...
     },
 };

To check whether your classifiers are valid (does not contain unknown
classifiers), you can use L<check-module-features> from
L<App::ModuleFeaturesUtils>:

 % check-module-features YourModule

To see the Python trove classifiers, you can use L<get-features-decl> from
L<App::ModuleFeaturesUtils>:

 % get-features-decl YourModule

There are other ways to read the trove classifiers, including accessing the
C<%FEATURES> variable directly.
